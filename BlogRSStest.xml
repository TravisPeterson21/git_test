            <description>"This year we are introducing a new type of blog post featuring state success stories. Installing and operationalizing Generate is a complex process that needs strong coordination and planning. CIID TA Providers support states as they build internal capacity and better data quality. Learn how Utah’s strong team supported their success and how Mississippi saw improvement in data quality and understanding of the data as each state submitted its first set of files using Generate:"</description>

            <title>The Year of Intentional Technical Assistance (TA)</title>
            <link>https://ciidta.communities.ed.gov/#program/blog10-the-year-of-intentional-technical-assistance</link>
            <description>What do we mean by “intentionality” when we talk about Generate and data integration? Our TA team spent a little time reflecting on our goals for supporting states this year, and the team overwhelmingly wanted to focus on being intentional in our work. But what does that mean? And how do we support states to be intentional? To us, it means being thinking ahead as we work with SEAs, structuring integration projects to be nimble enough to maintain momentum while handling inevitable bumps in the road. To start, here are some CIID tools that support thoughtful decision making and purposeful planning:</description>

            <link>https://ciidta.communities.ed.gov/#program/blog11-generate-data-review-and-validation-tools</link>
            <description>Since its inception, Generate has provided an effective method for ingesting and transforming data from state education agency (SEA) information systems to produce EDFacts submission files. As Generate continues to evolve, we have added new features to increase efficiency for reviewing and validating data. These new features, or utilities, aid the transition from SEA legacy processes to Generate created files. They also provide greater transparency and confidence for data quality.</description>

            <title>8 Reasons Why CIID Shifted Our Generate Documentation to GitBook</title>
            <link>https://ciidta.communities.ed.gov/#program/blog12-8-reasons-why-ciid-shifted-our-generate-documentation-to-gitbook</link>
            <description>The importance of having well organized and technical documentation is a high priority for teams and projects working in the tech field but managing and organizing documentation can be a daunting task. To tackle this challenge and simplify access for state education agencies (SEAs), we have deployed our Generate documentation on the GitBook platform. The Generate User Guide, Installation Guide and Release Notes have been combined and reorganized on GitBook. In this post, we will look at five reasons maintaining high-quality technical documentation is important and three reasons why we chose this tool as our documentation platform to support our state partners.</description>

            <description>In addition to being a key tool to support smooth transitions and sustainability, documentation created with CIID TA providers can help support engagement with OSEP for Differentiated Monitoring and Support (DMS) 2.0! SEA’s will be asked to show that they meet the requirements of OSEP’s General Supervision Part B Data Protocol and will be asked to share Integrated Monitoring Documents, Sustaining Compliance & Improvement Documents and Data Documents.</description>

            <description>In an ideal world, when SEAs have been meeting the criteria for timely, accurate and complete data, it will be a breeze to install Generate, write ETLS and match the new files to the legacy file. The state’s processes and systems have worked for years, data quality reports meet the criteria, and files are easy to submit, so everything must be correct. The picture taken of data is well composed and sharply focused.</description>
