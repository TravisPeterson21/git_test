# IDEA Files

This section serves as a comprehensive resource for states engaging with the Generate platform, focusing specifically on Fact Types related to the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). These Fact Types encompass various datasets critical for managing and reporting information related to IDEA. Below, you will find a curated list of IDEA Fact Types along with their associated files. Each Fact Type page provides essential information, including the files it handles, relevant toggle questions, CEDS connections, staging validations, ETL checklists, and other key details. This organized approach aims to streamline the onboarding process for states beginning work on any IDEA file in Generate, offering a centralized location for crucial information.

Explore the IDEA Fact Types:
